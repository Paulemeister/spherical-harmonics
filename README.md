# spherical-harmonics

Generates the spherical harmonics for each l and m.

Every combination will produce two videos with the figures showing the
- real part
- imaginary part
- absolute value squared

the flat videos will map each value to a color on a sphere
the dist(ance) videos will produce a shape where for each angle pair the distance from the origin is equal to the value of the function

blue: negative values
white: zero
red: positive values.

the colors are not comparable between any figures (colors chosen for max contrast)
